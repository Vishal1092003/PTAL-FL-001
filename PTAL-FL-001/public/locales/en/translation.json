    "heading": "Th Se Thathera: Revival Of India's Only UNESCO Listed Craftform",
    "p1": "The words ‘tambaa ke bartan’ sounds very nostalgic as it takes us back in time to the era our grannies stored water in them. Do you remember the time when our mothers used to insist, 'peetal ke bartan' (eat out of brass utensils) are good for health? But have you ever wondered who made these beautifully handcrafted cookware? What has become of that legacy as times go by? Generations remember this handcrafted utensils form out of brass (Pital), copper (Tamba) or bronze (Kansa) which defines cultural and historical identity undergoing their skill fade.",
    "p2": "Here is a story about the artisans of 'P-Tal' hailing from the Jandiala Guru region of Punjab. They are the heroes of these beautifully crafted products that take back in time and are proof of the present.",
    "p3": "A long time ago, Maharaja Ranjit Singh saw the need for a succession of arts and crafts in his new empire, and he thought Amritsar would be the perfect place for artists. He invited skilled workers from Kashmir and other parts of India to settle in Amritsar. The Thatheras, who worked with brass and copper, were among them. This colony of Thatheras was established in Jandiala Guru, a small town near Amritsar, and became a significant center for the craft. Over time, the craft faced challenges, with only a handful of artisans continuing the tradition.",
    "p4": "A proud community of individuals, spend their days hammering copper and brass sheets into vessels. They are unaware of the potential their craft holds. The community which was once characterised by happy faces, cheerful identities and beautiful craft have now been reduced to a group of old men suffering from hearing, heart and lung problems trying to feed their families. Yet, the community is spread across the country and is still carrying on the beautiful craft of handmade utensils.",
    "p5": "Out of the original 500 families at the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, a mere 50 craftsmen remain carrying on the legacy in Jandiala Guru, Punjab, the heart of the Thathera community. The younger Thatheras have been lured to jobs in factories or other livelihoods, but the elders remain intact and working as per reputation.",
    "p6": "One of our Thatheras is Manohar Lal ji. If it was not for him, we would have never been able to start this journey of P-Tal...",
    "p7": "In 2018, he was the only one from the entire village who believed in P-Tal's initiative and had faith in the revival of this craft, not even his son was ready to believe that this old-age legacy could be revived again. He has heard the sound of the hammer since he can remember. Being a Thathera is in his culture, his tradition. He truly is the torch-bearer of Karigar ki Virasat (Legacy of Artisans). The pride for his craft legacy and the skill he possesses makes him one of our master artisans.",
    "p8": "Just like Manohar Lal Ji's trust and resilience, Amrit Lal Ji wanted to preserve his identity as a Thathera. Taking immense pride in the work he does, Amrit Lal Ji has truly made every single Thathera in Jandiala Guru believe that their story and their heritage will reach every household in India!",
    "p9": "Hari Krishan Suri Ji is our 'copper mastermind', with a knack for experimenting and exploring, he is ever-ready to design new products in copper. His creation of a copper water dispenser is one of our hot-selling products. His products are not just pieces of craft, they are his identity.",
    "p10": "When you begin to revive a craft there is an initial product development and then the demand follows, and when there is a kind of demand that you think you can never meet, you suddenly realise there is still so much untapped potential.",
    "p11": "Harwinder Singh Ji's story is exactly like that. While working with P-tal he realised that he is again one of those who is made to explore the untapped potential and hence is now spearheading the work of craft revival with several other artisans working with him in his workshop.",
    "p12": "Our artisans are the foundation of P-Tal. Their belief and trust in our vision have helped us to grow as a brand. Without them, we would lose the beauty and essence we are so focused on reviving. They made us just like we encouraged them to revive their heritage.",

    "title": "Bhande Kalai Karalo (Tin Coating)",
    "p1": "“Bhande kalai kara lo” — this nostalgic street call would stir life into neighborhoods as households rushed out with their beloved brass and copper utensils for a fresh coat of tin. Watching the process was nothing short of magical — sparks flying, silver glimmers returning to the vessels, and the ‘kalaiwala’ performing his age-old ritual.",
    "h2": "Ayurveda has said it all",
    "p2": "Ayurveda has always advocated for the use of traditional metals in daily life. Brass, copper, bronze, and stone cookware are rich in medicinal properties. Though modern materials like steel and teflon gained popularity, concerns over health are pushing people back toward traditional methods. Copper retains heat efficiently but reacts with acidic foods — hence the need for a tin lining, known as *kalai*.",
    "h3": "What is Kalai (Tin Coating)?",
    "p3": "Kalai is the process of coating brass or copper utensils with tin to prevent harmful chemical reactions with food. Traditionally, re-tinning is done every 6–8 months. It ensures the cookware remains safe and enhances the cooking quality.",
    "h4": "The Process",
    "p4": "The utensil is first washed with caustic soda and acid to remove impurities. It is then heated in a temporary furnace while *nausadar* (ammonium chloride) is sprinkled — producing a white smoke and silvery finish.
